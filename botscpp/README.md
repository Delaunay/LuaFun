CPP Bots
========

The main objective of having this is to be able to redistribute trainmodels through workshop.
The API is not documented so it will involve a lot of reverse engineering to get this working.

Playing with bots it still possible with python but dota needs to be launched from python and bots
can not be easily shared.
