(lldb) break set -r . -s libobjc.A.dylib


The -s option takes a shared library as its value, and that limits the breakpoint to the specified shared library. You can specify the -s option more than once to specify more than one shared library for inclusion in the breakpoint search.

The -r option's value is a regular expression; if the symbol name matches that expression, it will be included in the breakpoint. . matches everything.
